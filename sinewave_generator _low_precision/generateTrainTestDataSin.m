% %%%% generate training and testing time series for ESN training
% The learning-and-testing script learn.m expects data to be contained in
% two matrices named sampleinput (of size inputdim x samplelength) and
% sampleout (of size outputdim x samplelength). Such two matrices must be
% the result of calling this script.

% Note: the script learn.m does training AND testing. Training is done with
% an initial sequence of the data generated here, testing is done on
% remaining data. Therefore, the samplelength should be chosen of
% sufficient length to provide data for both training and  testing.



n = 1:401;
sampleout = (1/2)*sin(n/4);
